Press Create. After creation of a new dish you will be taken to the list of all dishes, where you can see the new created dish.

`All dishes`
In the `All dishes` separator you can:
- see the list of dishes names available
- see the detail of a dish by clicking in a specific dish
- select one or more dishes and delete them

`Details of a dish`
When you press a dish to see its details, a new separator called `Dish details` opens. There you can make modifications to the details of the dish, delete it or just cancel and go back to the list of dishes.
